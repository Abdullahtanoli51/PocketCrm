                      Real estate is undeniably one of the most profitable businesses for centuries. People who managed this before are very different than what we have now. Back then, people had to rely on manual procedures to manage their real estate agency. But, in the era of technological advancements, real estate agency software has made these procedures very easy.

Today, whether a teenager or a grown man, everyone has phones in their pocket. So, why have traditional paperwork when you can achieve the same or even better results in a short time? Thus, the need for real estate agency management systems has become essential to the routine. These systems, for example, Pocket-CRM, automate multiple tasks, which saves a lot of time and sweat, making the whole process easier from leading to the closing of deals.

                          I tell you why you need a real estate agency app or
                          software. If you are already managing the real estate
                          business, you’ll probably know the hurdles I’m going
                          to talk about. One of the most itchy procedures is
                          client management, you don’t have that much time to
                          sit or schedule meetings in person. 
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          Plus, even if you do all that stuff by yourself which
                          of course is somehow manageable (when you have not so
                          many clients), but still, requires so much effort from
                          your side. It’s crucial to make your client satisfied
                          as he/she doesn’t know what you are going through or
                          how many meetings you already scheduled with other
                          clients.
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          With a real estate agency app like “Pocket-CRM”,
                          managing clients is fun now. Instead of manually
                          visiting the property site, you can have them listed
                          in your app for your clients to browse through the
                          wide category of properties. So, your clients don’t
                          have to come to your place to ask for new properties
                          when you frequently update your property listings.
                          This way, the clients will only reach you when they
                          want to negotiate their terms to buy any property.

                          These features make the management process more

                          For those who never know what a lead is, it basically
                          is the list of potential customers who have shown
                          interest in your properties. So, lead management is
                          identifying or capturing the clients' needs and
                          overall interest in your listings. Based on the lead
                          management record, you know better which client is
                          potentially interested. This way, you put all your
                          efforts in the right direction.

                          Traditionally, you visit each property venue or site

                          Pocket-CRM", you can upload all the properties in one
                          platform, and (share it with your clients with just
                          one tap) your clients can browse those properties
                          whenever they want. This way, we save time for both

                          of clients with your real estate agency. Remember,
                          every client is not a customer. The customer is
                          someone who buys one of your properties. The client is
                          just a client, and you manage your resources to
                          convert that client into a customer by effectively
                          showing the properties of his/her interest. Clients
                          appreciate the convenience and autonomy to explore
                          properties on their terms. On your end, this
                          translates to more informed and engaged clients who

                          Manginging inventory is also very difficult. You can’t
                          keep all the inventory details just in your notes,
                          also storing images of inventory mixes up with other
                          images in gallery and there are storage space issues
                          as well. Pocket CRM offers cloud storage of your
                          inventory images where you can store your inventory
                          details with all the images and You can share the
                          inventory with your leads and clients with just one
                          tap.
